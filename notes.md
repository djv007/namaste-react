## Episode 1 (The Inception) : 

Inception : 

Main job of all js libraries and frameworks is to optimise the most costly operation which is DOM manipulation . 
React does so by using js functions like createElement() directly which are available in browsers as browsers have js engine.

const heading = React.createElement(“h1” , {} , “hello world!”); 
console.log(heading); // object (This returns an object not a html element)
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(“root”));

root.render(heading); 
// above line is converting heading object into html element and putting it inside root element.

We do root.render(heading); 
/ suppose root already has some html elements inside it then when we write above line , existing html elements inside root will be replaced by heading.

4 . we can use react library in existing apps as it only renders in the element we speicfy iske upar neeche kuch bhi ho skta h aur 

5 . create a repo on github abd follow steps to push the code in local to git repo




## Episode 2(Igniting the app) : 
1 . To make app prod ready , we need to have some bundler , do code chunking , image optimisation etc
2 . npm : is a package manager for js libraries and frameworks 
3 . package.json : file gets generated when we write "npm init" command and package.json is a configuration for npm .
4 . package or dependency is same thing 
5 . MI package : is a bundler(webpack , parsel , veed etc)
Bundler : packs the app so that app can be shipped to prod.
6 . we will use parcer bundler
7 . 2 types of packages/dependencies we can have 
 1 . dev dependency and normal dependency

 "npm install -D parcel"   (-D means it's a dev dependency)

8 . caret(^) and tinde(~) : u know

9 . package-lock.json : locks the version : it keeps a record of every small upgrade of the version 

10 . in package-lock.json : parcel object -> integrity : is a hash 
     it keeps a track of exact version of all packages and their dependecy packages so that we can't say it's working in my local but not in prod

11 . Transitive dependencies : As we install a package it can have other dep. and those dep. can have other dep. so no_modules can have a lot of things - like node_modules me parcel folder will have a package.json for itself and same way each dep. will have 

12 . If we have package and package-lock files : we can create node_modules folder
13 . 'npx parcel index.html'   -> index.html is the source this command will host our app at local server
14 . npx : executing a package , npm : install/uninstall a package
15 . CDN links is not a good way to get react and react dom 
16 . Now we will emove CDN links and install react and react dom via npm and import them also in respective files like app.js to use them .
17 . now we will get an error cannot have import statement in script files - as script files are treated as normal js files , now they are not , so will add type = 'module' in script tag in index.html to fix this error .
18 . when we do 'npx parcel build index.html' -> we provide index.html as entry point and in our package.json we have given App.js as main , so it's conflicting entry points so rmove app.js from package.json file 
19 . this build commands gives 3 main files - index.html/css/js - have all our code 
20 . Any code which we can re-generate don't put on git. like dist folder and .parcel-cache
21 . parcel-cache is generated by parcel to cache the code to increase speed
22 . browserslist.dev : website to configure for how many borwsers our app should work 
     for that add in package.json : browserslist : {

     }
