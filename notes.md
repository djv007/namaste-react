## Episode 1 (The Inception) : 

Inception : 

Main job of all js libraries and frameworks is to optimise the most costly operation which is DOM manipulation . 
React does so by using js functions like createElement() directly which are available in browsers as browsers have js engine.

const heading = React.createElement(“h1” , {} , “hello world!”); 
console.log(heading); // object (This returns an object not a html element) - VVVI
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(“root”));

root.render(heading); 
// above line is converting heading object into html element and putting it inside root element.

We do root.render(heading); 
/ suppose root already has some html elements inside it then when we write above line , existing html elements inside root will be replaced by heading.

4 . we can use react library in existing apps as it only renders in the element we speicfy iske upar neeche kuch bhi ho skta h aur 

5 . create a repo on github abd follow steps to push the code in local to git repo




## Episode 2(Igniting the app) : 
1 . To make app prod ready , we need to have some bundler , do code chunking , image optimisation etc
2 . npm : is a package manager for js libraries and frameworks 
3 . package.json : file gets generated when we write "npm init" command and package.json is a configuration for npm .
4 . package or dependency is same thing 
5 . MI package : is a bundler(webpack , parsel , veed etc)
Bundler : packs the app so that app can be shipped to prod.
6 . we will use parcer bundler
7 . 2 types of packages/dependencies we can have 
 1 . dev dependency and normal dependency

 "npm install -D parcel"   (-D means it's a dev dependency)

8 . caret(^) and tinde(~) : u know

9 . package-lock.json : locks the version : it keeps a record of every small upgrade of the version 

10 . in package-lock.json : parcel object -> integrity : is a hash 
     it keeps a track of exact version of all packages and their dependecy packages so that we can't say it's working in my local but not in prod

11 . Transitive dependencies : As we install a package it can have other dep. and those dep. can have other dep. so no_modules can have a lot of things - like node_modules me parcel folder will have a package.json for itself and same way each dep. will have 

12 . If we have package and package-lock files : we can create node_modules folder
13 . 'npx parcel index.html'   -> index.html is the source this command will host our app at local server
14 . npx : executing a package , npm : install/uninstall a package
15 . CDN links is not a good way to get react and react dom 
16 . Now we will emove CDN links and install react and react dom via npm and import them also in respective files like app.js to use them .
17 . now we will get an error cannot have import statement in script files - as script files are treated as normal js files , now they are not , so will add type = 'module' in script tag in index.html to fix this error .
18 . when we do 'npx parcel build index.html' -> we provide index.html as entry point and in our package.json we have given App.js as main , so it's conflicting entry points so rmove app.js from package.json file 
19 . this build commands gives 3 main files - index.html/css/js - have all our code 
20 . Any code which we can re-generate don't put on git. like dist folder and .parcel-cache
21 . parcel-cache is generated by parcel to cache the code to increase speed
22 . browserslist.dev : website to configure for how many borwsers our app should work 
     for that add in package.json : browserslist : {

     }
     warning: in the working copy of 'package-lock.json', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
warning: in the working copy of 'package.json', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it


## episode 3 : laying the foundation
  babel documentation read
  explore jsx how to use img and href and a tag

1 . In package.json -> add 2 scripts : start : "parcel index.html" // run in dev mode
    and build : "parcel build index.html"  // run in prod mode
start keyword reserved by npm so : npm run start and npm start are same commands 
2 . React and jsx are different : jsx is for the ease of developers 
3 . JSX is not html , it is html like syntax
4 . javascript is a code that browser's js engine understand , now jsx can't be understood by js engine , 
    js engine understands          ecmascript 6 . So , parcel is transpiling (converted to a form that browser can understand) the code so that browser can understand.
    Babel : is a js compiler or a transpiler that converts the code from 1 form to another
    parcel gives the responsibility to transpile the code to Babel - babel's job is to transpile jsx code to what browser can understand
5 . jsx is converted to react.createElement() form by babel 
    JSX => React.createElement() => ReactElement(JS-object) => HTML element(remder)
6 . Attributes in jsx are given in camelCase like tabIndex instead of tabindex 
7 . enclose jsx in () if writing in multiple lines 
8 . React components : 2 types - 
    8.1 Class based components : old
    8.2 Functional components : new
    React functional component : is just a normal js function that returns jsx(or react element as jsx and react element are same)
    name start of a react comp with a capital letter to tell react that it is a react component.
9 . COMPONENT COMPOSITION : The process to render a component inside another component .
    for ex in App.js we have a func comp Title like 
       const Title = () => <div id = "title">I am title</div>

       const HeadingComponent = () => {
        <div id = "container">
        <Title/>
        <h1 className="heading">I am heading</h1>
        </div>
       }


        <Title/>  
        <Title></Title>
        {Title()}

        above 3 are same 

       we were rendering react elements liek this till now : root.render(header); where header is a react element
       to render react func comp we will do : root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);
10 .   To write js in jsx just write {} so inside {} we can write js 
11 . If we have to put a react element inside a react comp , we can use {} as a react element is a js variable , 
     so we can put it like a js variable
12 . suppose we are executing some js data in jsx like {data} , data is coming from api and is malicious , so jsx will
     sanitise data and then will execute it preventing cross origin attacks 



## episode 04 : Code in react 

1 . How to think about building an app like a food ordering app we will build 
    we build a wireframe 
2 . first half we coded with hardcoded data
3 . then we have dynamic data 
4 . passing a prop to a comp is same as passing an arg to a func 
5 . config-driven UI : webiste is driven by data - controlling the UI using config(coming from backend)
    liek delhi , mumbai , chennai me alag alag card carousel hoga cards ka swiggy website pe 
see swiggy's api call how data is coming on homepage - helpful in system design 
6 . Always give key(reserved keyword) as id in elements whenever using map to loop (never use loop index as keys)
    : so that react can recognise each loop lement uniquely and hence re-render only newly added or modified elements not 
    other elements improving performance
7 . See how we have src attribute in img tag as images are stored in a cloud on swiggy used that url and then each restaurant 
    has imageId of it , so using that as well .
8 . Also , see how we have de-structured data from props in res card comp.


## episode 05 : hooks

1 . react files structure - read about it online what's good practices - don't overthink about folder structure
2 . 3 extensions : .js , .jsx , .tsx : doesn't matter , we will use .js 
3 . while importing no need of file extension automatic assumed h js file hi hogi - some people use .js , .jsx or .tsx extension 
    although.
4 . Never put hard coded data into components folder like we have resData and img CDN url , also in header.js -> img src string
    put in separate file , inside utils folder or common 
5 . 2 types of imports/exports :
    5.1 default : only 1 per file -> imported without {}
    export default Component;
    import Component from "path";

    5.2 named : can be multiple -> imported using {}
    export const Component;
    import {Component} from "path";
6 . Feature : create a button - on click of it we only show restaurats which are top rated (rating > 4.0)
    If we just use a let variable to store array of res. and try to call a func. on button click which updates the res. array
    then react comp won't be re-rendered.
    So, we use state variable here 
    
    HOOK : is a normal js utility function that has some superpowers(logic) by react.
    - MI hooks : useState() and useEffect()

7 . whenever a state variabel chnages - react will re-render will comp.
8 . Reconciliation algo (React fiber) : came in react 16:  react uses this algo.
    Virtual DOM : is not actual DOM , is representation of actual DOM 
    like whenever we create an elemnt in react then we get a js object . this is called virtual DOM
    Diff algo : whenever any data changes in DOM like in res-container any res changes inside it , then diff algo will find difference 
    between previous virtual dom and new virtual dom and then actually update the DOM in every render cycle.

Q : why react is fast ?
A : as react does fast DOM manipulations as it uses virtual DOM 
    virtual DOM : old concept , but react created a diff algo to find difference between previous and current virtual DOMs

in useState we are doing array destructuring on the fly 
 const [listOfRes, setListOfRes] = useState(resList);
 // above line and below 2 lines are same
 const arr = useState(resList);
 const [listOfRes, setListOfRes] = arr;
